# Edward's Portfolio

This repository will contain a collection of projects and professional certificates that I have completed through Coursera's **IBM Data Science Certificate** program and **Google IT Support Professional Certificate** program.

It will also feature projects used to meet the competency-based grading system for the completion of my **Master of Science, Data Analytics - Data Science** from Western Governors University.  These files were written in Jupyter notebook using Python and are denotated using **D2##** for the class code and end in **.ipnyb**.
